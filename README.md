# X509 Certificate Utility

**Stop opening terminals just to inspect a certificate.**
View X.509 certificates, keystores, and signing requests directly inside VS Code — no OpenSSL commands needed.

## What it does

Double-click any certificate file and instantly see:

- **Subject & Issuer** — Common Name, Organization, Country, and more
- **Validity period** — clear expiry date with a visual status banner (valid / expiring soon / expired)
- **Fingerprints** — SHA-1 and SHA-256 with one-click copy
- **Public key** — algorithm and key size
- **Extensions** — SANs, Key Usage, Extended Key Usage, Basic Constraints, Name Constraints, and arbitrary critical or noncritical extensions
- **Lint findings** — errors, warnings, and informational notices tied to RFC references
- **RFC tooltips** — hover over sections and fields for relevant RFC guidance

## Expiry warnings at a glance

Never get caught by a surprise certificate expiration. Files expiring within 30 days get a yellow warning banner; expired certificates show a red one.

## Certificate chains

Multi-certificate files (chains, P7B bundles) are displayed as tabbed panels — one tab per certificate in the chain.

## CA certificates

Self-signed and CA certificates are clearly identified.

## Certificate Revocation Lists

CRL files open with issuer and update timestamps — no more decoding DER by hand.

## Supported formats

| Extension | Format |
| --- | --- |
| `.pem` | PEM — single certificate, certificate chain, public key, or private key |
| `.cer` `.crt` | DER or PEM certificate |
| `.der` | DER binary certificate, with DER SPKI/PKCS#8 key fallback |
| `.p7b` `.p7c` `.p7` | PKCS#7 certificate bundle |
| `.crl` | Certificate Revocation List |
| `.csr` | Certificate Signing Request (PKCS#10) |
| `.p12` `.pfx` | PKCS#12 keystore — password prompt if protected |
| `.key` `.pub` | PEM or DER public keys and unencrypted private keys, plus encrypted private-key detection without decryption prompts |
| `.jwk` | JSON Web Key public keys |

## Usage

- **Open a file** → the viewer opens automatically on double-click
- **Right-click** any supported file → *X509 Certificate Utility: Open*
- **Certificates panel** in the Explorer sidebar lists all cert files in the workspace
- **Hover** sections or fields in the certificate view to see RFC context
- **Copy lint report** from the validation banner for JSON output suitable for issue comments or reviews

## Settings

| Setting | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `certview.warningDaysBeforeExpiry` | `30` | Days before expiry to show the warning banner |
| `certview.showExpiredWarning` | `true` | Highlight expired certificates |

## Requirements

- VS Code 1.85 or later
- Works fully offline — no network access, no telemetry
- Files larger than 5 MiB are refused before parsing to protect the VS Code extension host from unbounded certificate, PKCS#7, or PKCS#12 processing

## Security and validation notes

- The viewer performs local lint checks for validity dates, CA/key usage consistency, SAN presence, and unrecognized extensions.
- Multi-certificate files are checked for issuer/subject ordering, CA marking, keyCertSign usage, validity nesting, and path length constraints.
- Critical and noncritical X.509 v3 extensions are shown with OID, display name, and decoded or hexadecimal value where available.
- Newer algorithms such as ML-DSA depend on the VS Code extension host's Node.js and OpenSSL support.
- Encrypted private keys are detected but not decrypted; CertView does not prompt for private-key passwords.
- Lint findings are guidance, not a complete compliance or WebPKI validation engine.

This artifact was produced with AI assistance and should be reviewed by a qualified professional before use as compliance evidence, legal submission, or external distribution.
